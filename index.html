<p>
    At my core, I'm driven by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for personal growth. 
    Presently, I channel this passion into my role as a Quant Developer at an Investment Bank, where I leverage the knowledge and skills acquired through my academic journey in Computer Science. 
    Despite holding a Master's degree in this dynamic field, I find myself continuously captivated and challenged by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and finance. This adventure of constant learning and application fascinates me each day.

<p>
    I believe in the simple yet powerful idea of being a little better today than I was yesterday. It’s this belief that keeps me on my toes, eagerly exploring new knowledge and experiences in Computer Science, Quant Finance, and staying active and healthy. However, Lately, I've been branching out to embrace more of what life has to offer, beyond my usual focus
</p>
<p>
    A simple yet profound joy of mine is witnessing progress. Observing my peers diligently working towards self-improvement and surpassing their previous achievements is a source of immense satisfaction for me.
    Hence, I'm here to share the journey with you. Through my experiences, discoveries, and the occasional stumble, I hope to offer insights, encouragement, and maybe a few shortcuts I’ve picked up along the way.

    Let’s grow together!
