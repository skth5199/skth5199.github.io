**Monocular Depth Estimation using Transfer Learning with focus on complex scenarios** (June 2021 – August 2021)
*	Concept of Transfer Learning was used to develop three monocular depth estimation approaches, as an alternative to the currently used expensive and limited LIDAR solutions. 
*	Three solutions (namely the Pix2pix model, the U-net with DenseNet encoder and the U-net with MobileNetv2 encoder) were produced and experimentally compared
*	The approaches were compared using a specifically engineered metric, in both complex indoor and outdoor situations, and the results were analysed. 
*	A Graphical user interface was developed to facilitate the hybridised and appropriate use of the engineered models

**Query Optimizer** (March 2021)
*	A Query Optimizer and estimator were built for SJDB (A simple data base designed by Dr Nicholas Gibbins)
*	The Estimator accepted a database logical query and estimated the total cost in terms of disk accesses
*	The Optimizer optimised a given query by pushing down the Selects, creating Joins and adding Projects

**HqOS: Threat Analysis** (February 2021)  
_Team size: 6_
*	The product’s website and whitepaper were analysed, the vulnerable Assets involved were highlighted
*	Misuse cases and security cases were designed
*	System and Security requirements were elicited and DFD diagrams were used to illustrate the same
*	Finally, the top 10 privacy risks were picked with justified rationale and appropriate steps were suggested

**Tweet Classification on the MediaEval Benchmarking Initiative** (January 2021)
*	The Twitter MediaEval data was analysed
*	Five tweet classification approaches were presented and critically analysed in depth
*	The approaches were then ranked based on this analysis

**Data Swiss Knife** (March 2020)
_Team size: 3_ 
*	Automated the data cleaning, modification, and model generation (machine learning models and deep learning)
*	The Deep learning models were automatically improved iteratively, based on the generated baseline model’s results

**Automated Negotiation Agent** (January 2021)
_Team size: 3_ 
*	User and opponent modelling, along with bidding strategy were engineered for the agent 
*	The agent was designed for a league with a closed setting and preference uncertainly enabled

**Wallee: Payment wallet**	(February 2019 – April 2019)
_Team size: 6_
*	Worked as the lead developer who assigned tasks to the other developers, developed backend modules and was responsible for seamless integration of the frontend with the backend
*	Django web framework and MySQL were used, and Scrum framework was followed for the development
*	Oversaw resolving of bugs that were discovered by the testers during the testing phase
