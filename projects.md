**Fraud Detection using Graph Machine learning** (Jan 2022 – Feb 2022) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/graph-based-fraud-detection))
*	A large financial dataset, which was the [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection) provided by Vesta, was integrated, cleaned and analysed.
*	A graph machine learning end-to-end solution was developed to detect fraud
*	The dataset used was the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset provided by Vesta on Kaggle
*	Two Relational graph convolution networks were developed and compared.

**Monocular Depth Estimation using Transfer Learning with focus on complex scenarios** (June 2021 – August 2021) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/depth_gen))
*	Concept of Transfer Learning was used to develop three monocular depth estimation approaches, as an alternative to the currently used expensive and limited LIDAR solutions. 
*	Three solutions (namely the Pix2pix model, the U-net with DenseNet encoder and the U-net with MobileNetv2 encoder) were produced and experimentally compared
*	The approaches were compared using a specifically engineered metric, in both complex indoor and outdoor situations, and the results were analysed. 
*	A Graphical user interface was developed to facilitate the hybridised and appropriate use of the engineered models

**Query Optimizer** (March 2021) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/query-optimiser))
*	A Query Optimizer and estimator were built for SJDB (A simple data base designed by Dr Nicholas Gibbins)
*	The Estimator accepted a database logical query and estimated the total cost in terms of disk accesses
*	The Optimizer optimised a given query by pushing down the Selects, creating Joins and adding Projects

**HR Analytics** (March 2021) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/HR-Analytics))
*	HR dataset was analysed using R to predict if an employee would be promoted
*	Dataset used was the [HR Analysis Case Study Dataset](https://github.com/skth5199/HR-Analytics)
*	The data was cleaned, analysed and visualized.

**Tweet Classification on the MediaEval Benchmarking Initiative** (January 2021)
*	The Twitter MediaEval data was analysed
*	Five tweet classification approaches were presented and critically analysed in depth
*	The approaches were then ranked based on this analysis

**Data Swiss Knife** (March 2020) ([github](https://github.com/ry05/dataswissknife))
_Team size: 3_ 
*	Automated the data cleaning, modification, and model generation (machine learning models and deep learning)
*	The Deep learning models were automatically improved iteratively, based on the generated baseline model’s results

**Wallee: Payment wallet**	(February 2019 – April 2019) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/Wallee))
_Team size: 6_
*	Worked as the lead developer who assigned tasks to the other developers, developed backend modules and was responsible for seamless integration of the frontend with the backend
*	Django web framework and MySQL were used, and Scrum framework was followed for the development
*	Oversaw resolving of bugs that were discovered by the testers during the testing phase

**HackMan**	(February 2019 – April 2019) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/HackMan))
_Team size: 3_
* A Hackathon Management System made to aid in better organization of hackathons
* This website was built using Python and the Django web framework
* It featured a participant dashboard, a judge dashboard and a cafeteria dashboard

**UoS Book exchange**	(March 2021 – May 2021) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/UoS_Books))
_Team size: 2_
* An online book exchange made for the students of University of Southampton
* This website was built using MERN stack
* Functional requirements and architecture can be found in the github repo

**Constructoo**	(March 2021 – April 2021) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/constructoo))
_Team size: 3_
* Constructoo is an Android application for construction deliveries
* It assists the managers in a company by controlling the packages, determining the construction sites, and assigning the specified driver for this shipment
* Functional requirements and architecture can be found in the github repo

**Zoo Management System**	(January 2018 – March 2018) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/zms))
_Team size: 5_
*	A Zoo Management Application built to aid in effective and efficient management of animals in the zoo
*	The application was built using Java Applets and the backend was made using MySQL
*	Separate portals for Manager, Staff, Head of zoo and the Vet were developed


**HqOS: Threat Analysis** (February 2021)
_Team size: 6_
*	The product’s website and whitepaper were analysed, the vulnerable Assets involved were highlighted
*	Misuse cases and security cases were designed
*	System and Security requirements were elicited and DFD diagrams were used to illustrate the same
*	Finally, the top 10 privacy risks were picked with justified rationale and appropriate steps were suggested

**Automated Negotiation Agent** (January 2021) ([github](https://github.com/skth5199/Agent21))
_Team size: 3_ 
*	User and opponent modelling, along with bidding strategy were engineered for the agent 
*	The agent was designed for a league with a closed setting and preference uncertainly enabled
