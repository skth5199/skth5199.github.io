## Projects

**Monocular Depth Estimation using Transfer Learning with focus on complex scenarios** (June 2021 – August 2021)
*	Concept of Transfer Learning was used to develop three monocular depth estimation approaches, as an alternative to the currently used expensive and limited LIDAR solutions. 
*	Three solutions (namely the Pix2pix model, the U-net with DenseNet encoder and the U-net with MobileNetv2 encoder) were produced and experimentally compared
*	The approaches were compared using a specifically engineered metric, in both complex indoor and outdoor situations, and the results were analysed. 
*	A Graphical user interface was developed to facilitate the hybridised and appropriate use of the engineered models

**Query Optimizer** (March 2021)
*	A Query Optimizer and estimator were built for SJDB (A simple data base designed by Dr Nicholas Gibbins)
*	The Estimator accepted a database logical query and estimated the total cost in terms of disk accesses
*	The Optimizer optimised a given query by pushing down the Selects, creating Joins and adding Projects

**HqOS: Threat Analysis** (February 2021)  
_Team size: 6_
*	The product’s website and whitepaper were analysed, the vulnerable Assets involved were highlighted
*	Misuse cases and security cases were designed
*	System and Security requirements were elicited and DFD diagrams were used to illustrate the same
*	Finally, the top 10 privacy risks were picked with justified rationale and appropriate steps were suggested

**Tweet Classification on the MediaEval Benchmarking Initiative** (January 2021)
*	The Twitter MediaEval data was analysed
*	Five tweet classification approaches were presented and critically analysed in depth
*	The approaches were then ranked based on this analysis

**Data Swiss Knife** (March 2020)
_Team size: 3_ 
*	Automated the data cleaning, modification, and model generation (machine learning models and deep learning)
*	The Deep learning models were automatically improved iteratively, based on the generated baseline model’s results

**Automated Negotiation Agent** (January 2021)
_Team size: 3_ 
*	User and opponent modelling, along with bidding strategy were engineered for the agent 
*	The agent was designed for a league with a closed setting and preference uncertainly enabled

**Wallee: Payment wallet**	(February 2019 – April 2019)
_Team size: 6_
*	Worked as the lead developer who assigned tasks to the other developers, developed backend modules and was responsible for seamless integration of the frontend with the backend
*	Django web framework and MySQL were used, and Scrum framework was followed for the development
*	Oversaw resolving of bugs that were discovered by the testers during the testing phase

Abstract: The construction of a building involves tremendous investments of time, money, and emotion. Therefore, every stakeholder involved in the process starting from construction companies to the tenants wants to make sure that a structure is built well and that it can serve its purpose without any safety hazards. While the majority of factors concerning a building’s safety are evaluated manually, there are factors like detecting visible structural damage that might incur a severe investment of time via manual inspection. Therefore, the need of the hour is to engineer automated systems that with the help of computer vision techniques will detect visually discernible defects in buildings. The paper proposes two approaches, namely digital image processing-based and deep learning-based that deal with creating surface crack inspection systems and attempt to showcase their performances in perspective by comparing their results across four different types of surface crack image datasets.

Identification of Criminal Activity Hotspots using Machine Learning to Aid in Effective Utilization of Police Patrolling in Cities with High Crime Rates. In 2019 4th International Conference on Computational Systems and Information Technology for Sustainable Solution (CSITSS) (Vol. 4, pp. 1-6). IEEE.
Abstract: Criminal activity has always been a major deterrent in human progress and the constant presence of criminal activities stemming out of multifarious causes has been a hindrance for human sustainable living. The problem further aggravates when there is a dearth of police force to prevent crime. In countries like India where the police to population ratio is much less than the United Nations' Standard, the need of the hour is to efficiently utilize the existing force to prevent crimes. In this paper, we propose a solution that would facilitate effective distribution of police forces in a city among multiple districts based on the extent to which each district is prone to crime at a given hour, in a given day, for a given month. We have used the Chicago Crime Dataset in this work. The problem has been modelled as an imbalanced classification problem and supervised machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Trees have been employed and their performances have been evaluated. In particular, the Gradient Boosting Tree has achieved the best performance in our case.
